Once a marshy lowland beyond Ertal, one of the vassal-towns absorbed by the growth of the City itself. Now a place of palisades, and reclaimed lowlands. The outer reaches of the district flood with the river Sinis in Spring. Inhabited primarily by the less fortunate or less known among the Gravebound, who descend from the First Monarchâ€™s followers.

The locals support the Gravebound or Firebrand cults.
