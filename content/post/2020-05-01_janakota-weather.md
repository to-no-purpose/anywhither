This is my take on [Daniel Sell’s Six Dimensional Weather](https://whatwouldconando.blogspot.com/2017/04/five-dimensional-weather.html) for my jungle island setting of Janakota. I’ve made a few tweaks of my own, but the idea is the same: you pick a spot and begin rolling to generate weather. Travel across Janakota is supposed to be difficult, not least because of the chaotic weather. This generator reflects that.

## Weather Generation

I break down each day into six 4-hour Watches. This generator is intended to generate distinct weather for every Watch, not each day.

The default die is a d8. A result of 1 moves the weather a single hex upwards and subsequent results continue on clockwise. Results of 7 or greater keep you in the same hex. Some hexes specify a different die – larger dice make the hex stickier, the weather more persistent. Smaller dice make the weather more fleeting.

Some hexes are split. The top-left result applies during the day and the bottom-right result applies at night.

Some hexes have walls. If a result leads you into a wall, “slide” to the nearest hex. Some walls are marked by an X. Treat these the same as a roll of 7+. Some walls are marked by arrows – these can be traversed only in the direction indicated by the arrow.

All these rules contribute to the chaos – but some patterns do emerge. Sporestorms and Spiderblooms are rare but when they happen they’re likely to stick around for a while. Superblooms are rare and fleeting. Typhoons are uncommon and always in the midst of a deluge of rain.

### Weather Types

Here’s a closer look at the types of weather on Janakota. A little context: you must roll equal to or less than a target number but above your Fatigue to succeed any given check. Resilience is essentially HP.

|Weather|Description|Effects|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Rain|A light rain pelts down. It’s a bit tiring to deal with.|+1 Fatigue|
|Downpour|Rain pours down. Rivers swell and most creatures seek shelter.|+2 Fatigue, rivers impassable, resting impossible|
|Typhoon|Wind and rain assault the island. All but the most desperate shelter until it passes.|+2 Fatigue, rivers impassable, resting impossible, tents useless|
|Wind|Heavy wind scours the landscape.|+1 Fatigue|
|Fog|A thick fog hangs to the ground. Navigation is difficult.|+1 Fatigue per 5 km traveled|
|Ash|A cloud of choking volcanic ash descends on the area.|+1 Fatigue and -1 Resilience per 5 km traveled|
|Clear|Clear skies – a beautiful sight!|None|
|Burning Sun|The sun scorches your skin.|+1 Fatigue|
|Dead Air|The air is hot, still, and muggy. Bugs swarm everywhere.|+1 Fatigue, -1 Resilience|
|Superbloom|Everything in the area sprouts blooms. Plants, tree stumps, creatures.|???|
|Sporestorm|A storm of fungal spores overtakes the area.|???|
|Spiderbloom|A mass of floating spiders rides the wind.|???|

Superblooms, Sporestorms and Spiderblooms require a bit more thought. I want them to have a much more significant impact on the world than the other types of weather.

### Example

And here’s a week’s worth of random generation. The weather soon turns to torrential rain and gets dangerously close to a typhoon before settling into an extended Sporestorm.

|Day|0-4|4-8|8-12|12-16|16-20|20-0|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Monday|Fog|Rain|Clear|Clear Skies|Dead Air|Dead Air|
|Tuesday|Dead Air|Rain|Downpour|Downpour|Rain|Rain|
|Wednesday|Rain|Fog|Rain|Rain|Downpour|Downpour|
|Thursday|Rain|Rain|Rain|Rain|Downpour|Downpour|
|Friday|Downpour|Rain|Rain|Rain|Rain|Rain|
|Saturday|Fog|Rain|Downpour|Wind|Wind|Sporestorm|
|Sunday|Sporestorm|Sporestorm|Wind|Sporestorm|Sporestorm|Sporestorm|

## Equipment

The last critical piece of this system is _gear_. Gear to protect yourself from all this nasty weather. Here are a few examples.

|Item|Description|Effect|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Cloak|A simple waterproofed cloak.|Prevents 1 Fatigue from rain unless resting.|
|Feather-Coat|A coat of giant feathers. Very waterproof.|Prevents 2 Fatigue from rain unless resting.|
|Tent|A small, burly shelter.|Prevents all Fatigue from rain while resting.|
|Sunjelly|A pouch of sweet-smelling jelly to be smeared on the skin.|Prevents all Fatigue from sunburn.|
|Bugjelly|A pouch of sharp-smelling jelly to be smeared on the skin.|Prevents all Fatigue and Resilience loss from bug bites.|
|Ashmask|A face covering of finely woven fibers.|Prevents all Resilience loss from ash.|
