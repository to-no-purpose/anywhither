I am Tetraqonta, a Sacred One of the Quiet House. I was initiated into the Gravebound Cult at the age of thirteen—the day before the Great Beast attacked Qal Ashen. I gained a new family, though I lost my Mother, Nanmesh, and my Father, Triēkontaetes. I secluded myself deep within my residence the day after. I remained secluded for the last twelve years. I am told I am known only for my seclusion. I am indebted to my Ear, K'arasun, for ruling Lower Ertal in my stead. I now exercise my power as Listener. I have as my seal the Seer—an eye wide with fear.

### Languages

-   **Low Ashenite.** Everyone Speaks This!
-   **High Ashenite.** From the era of the First Monarch; too formal.
-   **Dirge.** Ancient song-language sung at funerals; used for
    proclaiming omens and executions.
-   **Beranothi.** Dead language of Beranoth; poetic, with six levels of
    politeness.

### Family

-   Nanmesh, my Mother, was Listener before me. Lost when the Beast attacked.
-   Triēkontaetes, my Father, was especially dedicated to the Cult. Lost when the Beast attacked.
-   Ninlil, my aunt, is Grand General of Nunamnir. Nanmesh\'s sister.

## Templates

### Sacred One of the Quiet House \[A\]

-   **I am immune to being ignored.**
-   **Prominence:** I catch everyone\'s eye. In like, a gravitas-y way. Denizens of the Underworld and Shades always treat me as a friend. Mindless undead ignore the orders of other Ashenites in favor of mine.
-   **Sanctuary:** Non-Divine creatures who wish to harm me must **save** or be unable to so.
