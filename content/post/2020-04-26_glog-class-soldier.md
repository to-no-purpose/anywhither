This class is intended to be another alternative to the Fighter, like the hireling-focused Veteran. The Soldier is straightforward and excels at damage output and survivability. The starting equipment will need to be changed for your setting: the equipment here is for an upcoming game set on Janakota, an island off the coast of Yoon-Suin. Each set of gear here includes an item specific to a location in Yoon-Suin and is intended to hint at the character’s history.

## Class: Soldier

### Starting Equipment

Roll 1d3:

1. Yellow Legion leather armor, sword, bow, 20 arrows
